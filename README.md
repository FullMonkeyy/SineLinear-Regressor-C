# SineLinear-Regressor-C++
Hi,here you will find the code to develop a Machine Learning linear regressor model with an approximated function sine which lead the algorithm not to forget the error during the training.

The program is completely coded in C language. Actually I wanted to show how also an low level programming language as C could be optimal for base machine learning programs.

Beside, you will find also an documentation which is written in italian (this just becouse I'm italian too) where i wrote about the algorithm it self and not the code.
I will release a full english documentation soon.
I hope you will appreciate it.
